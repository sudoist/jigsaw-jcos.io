## My Thoughts

Recommended!

The main character starts as the typical weakling, but he manages to survive and adapt on his own.

Most of the supporting characters—classmates, cops—have understandable motivations, making them feel grounded.

The exception, of course, are the psychos, whose actions can be unpredictable.

Overall, it's an exciting read. Definitely worth checking out!
