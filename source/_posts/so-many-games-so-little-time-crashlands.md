## First Impressions
Hey there! Just finished [Crashlands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391730/Crashlands/), and wow—I lost some sleep over this one. Just one more recipeee!!!

Originally released in 2016, I was late to the party, but no worries—I still had a blast playing it. It went on sale on Steam and Google Play, so I grabbed the Android version since I figured I’d play it more often (plus, it was cheaper!).

## Gameplay

### Crafting & Combat Fun

At its core, [Crashlands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391730/Crashlands/) is all about crafting and battling to gather materials for more crafting—seems simple, but there’s a lot more depth to it.

Later stages can get a bit grindy, but never to the point where it feels like a slog.

There’s always something to do—crafting weapons, furniture, and more, all while exploring a massive alien world.

## Story

### A Quirky Space Adventure

You play as Flux Dabes, a shipping expert (who, fun fact, is actually a she! Took me half the game to realize that, lol).

Her mission? Deliver packages. Sounds simple, but things go sideways fast.

Then there’s Juicebox, your robot companion, who constantly follows you around, delivering hilarious dialogue throughout the game.

The story pacing feels just right, keeping things interesting while never dragging on too long.

## TLDR

### Should You Play It?

Yes! If you’re looking for a fun, story-driven game that’ll keep you entertained for hours, [Crashlands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391730/Crashlands/) is worth every penny—especially if you catch it on sale.

There are also some cool perks and achievements if you play other [Butterscotch Shenanigans](https://www.bscotch.net/) games.

Fun fact: [Crashlands](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391730/Crashlands/) has a great dev backstory—definitely worth checking out how it came to be.
