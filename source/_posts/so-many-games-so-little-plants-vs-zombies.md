## TL;DR

A highly addictive and fun tower defense game where you strategically place plants to fend off waves of zombies.

The Survival Endless mode keeps you coming back, and the Zen Garden adds a chill collecting aspect.

A must-play classic!

## First Impressions

I first played Plants vs. Zombies back in 2009 when some friends introduced me to it.

At first, I found it a bit strange—most tower defense games use a top-down perspective, but this one plays more like a side-scroller.

Before I knew it, I had spent over 8 hours straight in story mode.

## Gameplay

The core mechanics are simple but addictive:

- Place different types of plants to stop zombies from reaching your house.
- Each plant has unique abilities, from Peashooters that fire at zombies to Wall-nuts that act as barriers.
- Zombies also come in different types, requiring strategy to counter them effectively.
- The game gradually increases difficulty, keeping things fresh and engaging.

One of the best features is Survival Endless, where you try to last as many waves as possible.

Some players have reached thousands of flags, but my personal best is 78 Flags!

## Story

The story is minimal but charming: zombies are invading your house, and you must use your plant army to stop them.

Along the way, you encounter Crazy Dave, who adds humor and offers useful items.

The quirky, lighthearted theme makes the game even more enjoyable.

## Notables

- Survival Endless mode keeps the game engaging long after finishing the main campaign.
- Simple mechanics, deep strategy—easy to learn but challenging to master.
- Charming art and humor make it fun for all ages.
- Zen Garden mode lets you collect and care for plants, offering a relaxing break from the action.

## My Thoughts

Plants vs. Zombies is one of those games that never gets old.

Whether you're a casual player or a completionist aiming for high survival scores, there's something for everyone.

It's highly replayable, entertaining, and still holds up even years after its release.

If you haven't played it yet, give it a shot!
