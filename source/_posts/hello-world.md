Hello! This is my first post.

I used to have another blog and use this as my landing page but it is now inactive.

I’ll be trying to use this from now on.

I haven’t really thought about what to write here.

I just want to be able search myself correctly from Google results.

Maybe next time I’ll land on the number one spot.

By the way I really like black backgrounds with shiny life stream like images from [Final Fantasy 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII).

Well that’s about it for the first post.

Hope I’ll be able to write again soon.
