Hey,

I haven't seen an ad using my computer for years thanks to an Ad Blocker.

The extension I'm using was no longer supported.

An alternative I found is **[uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en)**.

Just activate it then select the max settings, with this you should be able to block ads again even in YouTube.

That's all.

Bye.
