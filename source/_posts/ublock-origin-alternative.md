## What Happened to uBlock Origin?

For years, I’ve relied on uBlock Origin to browse ad-free.

But recently, Chrome stopped supporting it, leaving many users without a reliable ad blocker.

## Best uBlock Origin Alternative for Chrome

If you need a replacement, try [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en).

It’s a lightweight extension that still blocks YouTube ads and more.

## How to Set Up uBlock Origin Lite

1. Install [uBlock Origin Lite](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin-lite/ddkjiahejlhfcafbddmgiahcphecmpfh?hl=en) from the Chrome Web Store.
2. Activate it and enable the highest settings for better ad-blocking.
3. Enjoy an ad-free experience, even on YouTube.
