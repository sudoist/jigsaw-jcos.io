## Laravel Idea Plugin Is Now Free for PhpStorm Users (As of July 30, 2025)

If you're a Laravel developer using PhpStorm, here's some good news: **Laravel Idea is now completely free starting July 30, 2025.**

This JetBrains plugin used to be a paid add-on, and I personally paid for it in the past—on top of my WebStorm license.

It was absolutely worth it back then, and now that it’s free for PhpStorm users, there’s no reason not to take advantage of it.

> Expired subscriptions from my Jetbrains account.

### What Is Laravel Idea?

Laravel Idea is a powerful plugin that brings smart Laravel-specific features directly into PhpStorm, including:

- Blade autocompletion
- Livewire component support
- Route and model relationship navigation
- Code generation tools
- Smart suggestions for Eloquent, facades, validation rules, and more

Whether you're working on traditional Blade apps or full-stack Livewire applications, Laravel Idea supercharges the development experience.

### How to Get It

You just need an active PhpStorm subscription.

Open your IDE, go to the plugin marketplace, search for Laravel Idea, and install it.

No separate license or purchase required anymore.

### Final Thoughts

This is a fantastic move by JetBrains and the Laravel Idea developer.  
It lowers the barrier for Laravel developers to work more efficiently without additional cost.

If you haven't tried Laravel Idea before, now's the best time to check it out.
