### Title: The Greatest Estate Developer
✍️ Author: Lee Hyunmin

🎨️ Illustrator: Kim Hyunsoo

📅 Published: 2021–Ongoing

📌 Status: Ongoing

📜 Type: Manhwa – Read left to right

## TL;DR

An unexpectedly great manhwa that quickly became one of my recent favorites.

It's another isekai story where the protagonist is transported into a book, but things take a turn when he gains consciousness as one of the villains.

The latest season ended, leading into the final arc set to start in April 2025.

Lloyd, the main character, is hilariously effective at turning everyone into his laborers, making for an entertaining and unique story.

Highly recommend checking this one out!

## Summary

A civil engineering student wakes up as a character in the novel he was reading.

His noble family is drowning in debt, but he uses his modern engineering knowledge to introduce floor heating, apartments, sewage systems, and other innovations in a medieval setting.

The novel’s original story is a tragedy, but Lloyd is determined to change fate by making money, manipulating people, and improving his territory.

## Notables

- Strengths: Likable characters, great humor, and fantastic art—especially Lloyd’s scummy expressions, which enhance the comedy.
- Weaknesses: Can feel a bit repetitive at times, though the introduction of different races keeps things fresh.

## My Thoughts

Recommended!

Water is good. Water is Lloyd. Lloyd is good.

The comedy blends perfectly with the art style, making it a joy to read.

Supporting characters add to the ridiculousness of Lloyd’s antics, and even the novel’s supposed protagonist eventually gets caught up in his flow.

Overall, it’s a fun and engaging read. Definitely worth checking out!

Patiently waiting for the final arc and the story’s conclusion.
