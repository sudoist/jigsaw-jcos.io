### Title: The Greatest Estate Developer
✍️ Author: Lee Hyunmin

🎨️ Illustrator: Kim Hyunsoo

📅 Published: 2021–Ongoing

📌 Status: Ongoing

📜 Type: Manhwa – Read left to right

## TL;DR

An unexpected manhwa to one of my recent favorites.

It's another isekai story to a book but the story changes when he gained consciousness as one of the bad characters.

Ended the season to start the final arc in april 2025

Lloyd is the main character set out to make everyone his laborer which is the main theme but is hilariously effective.

Can recommend check this one out.

## Summary

A civil engineering student wakes up as one of the character in the book he is reading.

His noble family is drowning in debt and he uses his knowledge to build floor heating, apartments,
sewage and other modern building in medieval setting.

The story of the book is a tragedy which he works his way to avoid.

He makes money and manipulates people to prevent the bad things and improve his terrirtory.

## My Thoughts

Recommended!

Water is good, Water is Lloyd, Lloyd is good

the comedy is good and goes well with the art.

Other characters also add in to the ridiculousness of Lloyd.

Even the supposedly guy, the book's protagonist gets into LLoyd's flow later in the story.

Overall, it's a fun read. Definitely worth checking out!
Patiently waiting to read until the conclusion
