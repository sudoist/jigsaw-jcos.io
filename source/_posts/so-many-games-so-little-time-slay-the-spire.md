## TL;DR

I’ve been playing Slay the Spire on and off lately.

It’s a roguelike deck-builder that lets you choose a character, build up a deck run after run, and try to climb higher with better combos and strategy each time.

Highly recommended!

## Gameplay

What I like most about it: it doesn’t punish you for putting it down.

Since it’s turn-based, there’s no rush to act. You can play a few turns, get interrupted (say, by a toddler demanding snacks), and come back without losing your flow.

The autosave between turns helps too.

The card mechanics are deep enough to experiment with new builds, but simple enough not to feel overwhelming.

## Story

Not a story-heavy experience, but one of those games that stick with you because of how tight and replayable it is.

## Notables

- Strengths: 
  - Thinking game that respects your time
  - Smooth deck-building and card synergies
  - Something you can play while multitasking or parenting  - 

- Weaknesses:
  - Can be frustrating when RNG is not good
  - There can be a problem when brute forcing specific builds per run

- Best Played in:
  - Mobile, Switch or Steam Deck where you can pause and get back later 

## My Thoughts

There’s a nice rhythm to playing it relaxed—you get to make small, satisfying decisions without needing long sessions or full focus.
