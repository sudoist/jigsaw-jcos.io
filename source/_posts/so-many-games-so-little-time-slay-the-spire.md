## TL;DR

I’ve been playing Slay the Spire on and off lately.

It’s a roguelike deck-builder where you choose a character, build up a deck run after run, and try to climb higher each time with better combos and strategies.

Highly recommended!

## Gameplay

What I like most: it doesn’t punish you for putting it down.

Since it’s turn-based, there’s no rush to act. You can play a few turns, get interrupted (say, by a toddler demanding snacks), and come back later without losing your flow.

The autosave between turns helps too.

The card mechanics are deep enough to experiment with builds but simple enough not to feel overwhelming.

## Story

Not a story-heavy game, but one that sticks with you because of how tight and replayable the core experience is.

## Notables

#### Strengths: 
  - Thinking game that respects your time
  - Smooth deck-building and card synergies
  - Great for multitasking or parenting

#### Weaknesses:
  - Can be frustrating when RNG isn’t on your side
  - Brute-forcing specific builds isn’t always viable

#### Best Played 0n:
  - Mobile, Switch, or Steam Deck—any platform where you can pause and come back later
    - (I bought it on multiple platforms!)

## My Thoughts

There’s a nice rhythm to playing it in a relaxed way. You get to make small, satisfying decisions without needing long sessions or full focus.

Try it out.
