One day, there was a boy who went to hang out with his friends.

There they had a couple of couple of beers.

After some time he got drunk and went home.

When he woke up he remembered the Ukelele they were playing.

He was still dizzy and could throw up but he went for his guitar then went into the wheatfield.....

And poof! it became Koko Krunch..... Errr the video below.
