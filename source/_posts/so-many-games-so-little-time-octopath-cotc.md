## TL;DR

I started playing Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent after wanting something new following my time with Slay the Spire.

It’s a single-player turn-based JRPG with classic mechanics, party building, and a gacha element that’s surprisingly fair.  
Feels a bit like Final Fantasy Brave Exvius (FFBE), which was the last mobile Square Enix game I played.

I’ve always enjoyed playing healer or support roles, and from reviews I read beforehand, this game offers solid healing, buff, and debuff mechanics.

Yes, it’s another mobile gacha game, but not overly greedy in my experience—you can do most of the game free-to-play.

If you like JRPGs with flexible play sessions, give it a try!

## Gameplay

Controls are straightforward—just up, down, left, and right.

There’s no bullshit energy system (huge plus), though there are some time-gated features like towers and material generators (e.g., Burning Incense). These are acceptable for me.

Like Slay the Spire, battles are turn-based and can be played semi-AFK.

The Boost system adds strategic depth, and the story is much better than I expected from a mobile title.

Easy to get into, but it gets more interesting once you unlock buffs, debuffs, and keepers, etc.

## Story

I usually skip mobile game stories, but Champions of the Continent is an exception.

My favorite so far is Auguste from Master of Fame.  
The arc unexpectedly went dark when he killed an actress during a rehearsal scene involving choking—a moment I didn’t see coming. 

## Progression

Rubies (premium currency) are scarce, but early game pulls are enough to get you started.

Even 4-star units can carry you through the first few story arcs, though difficulty spikes hit hard in the final Bestower of All chapters.

Resource management is important—checking guides can help optimize your units.

I don’t follow meta or tier lists since it’s single-player—just pulling for characters I like.

Overall, it feels fair: save your Rubies for either meta picks or personal favorites.

## Notables

#### Strengths: 
  - Free-to-play friendly
  - No energy system (farm EXP anytime)
  - Lots of characters and team compositions

#### Weaknesses:
  - Live service risk—could shut down like FFBE
  - Post-story slowdown after finishing Bestower of All 

## My Thoughts

This was my entry point into the Octopath Traveler series, and I’ve enjoyed it enough to grab both mainline games on sale.

A great choice if you want a new JRPG to sink into without feeling pressured by competitive play.

May the sacred flame guide you.
