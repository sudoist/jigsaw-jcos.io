## TL;DR

Iâ€™ve started playing Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent after wanting to try something new from playing Slay the Spire.

Found this single player turn based JRPG with classic mechanics and team building.

Kinda feels similar to FFBE but different. (Last mobile SQUARE ENIX game played)

Want to try something new and go back to playing a healer class.

Always want to play healer or support and read from reviews that this game have a good healing, buff/debuff mechanics.

Another mobile gacha game but not that too greedy for me.

Can do most of the game on free to play.

Try it out!

## Gameplay

Controls are simple with up, down, left and right.

No bullshit energy system but there are some time gated features like towers, mats generators (Burning Incense), still acceptable for me.

Same with Slay the Spire, turn based and playable semi afk.

The boost system adds complexity to battles and the story was surprisingly good.

Easy to get into but gets interesting when you get access to buffs/debuffs, keepers, etc.

## Story

I usually skip the story on mobile games but this one is an exception.

My favorite was Auguste from Master of Fame, did not expect for it to go dark after being introduced he killed an actress on rehearsal/practice of choking.

## Progression

As mentioned before, the Rubies are scarce but early game the pulls are enough to get started.

Random team composition with 4 star units are strong enough to finish first few parts of the story.

Though the difficulty spikes on the last Bestower of All chapters.

Resource management is needed, needs some checking for guides and stuff for your units.

Contents are doable as free to play.

I haven't played any of the Octopath Traveler game and I don't really follow the meta on which to pull so I just played however I want.  
This is a single player game after all. No pressure.

Over all feels like the game is pretty fair, just save your Rubies for meta or favorite characters you like.

## Notables

#### Strengths: 
  - Free to play friendly
  - No energy system (Can farm exp for characters as long as you want)
  - Lots of characters and combos

#### Weaknesses:
  - Live service game, can be shut down like FFBE (Final Fantasy Brave Exvius)
  - After finishing main story (Bestower of All), game slows down and you might not want to play for a while. 

## My Thoughts

A great game to play if you want a new JRPG to get into.

Served as an entry way to the Octopath Traveler series.

Got the 2 games on sale.

May the sacred flame guide you.
