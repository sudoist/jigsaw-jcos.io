Hello,

Just sharing this photo here since it&#8217;s getting some traction in [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@jcosio).

This is one of my photos taken when I was travelling to Ilo Ilo last year.

I was too lazy to write something about the trip with the other photos.

Feels good to see this being used by other people.

Maybe I'll try to add some more blogs that use my photos.

Happy travelling!
