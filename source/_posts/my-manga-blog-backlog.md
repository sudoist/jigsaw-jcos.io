## Introduction

I’ve been reading manga, manhwa, and watching anime since my teens.

Some of the first anime I watched were Voltes V, Daimos, Yaiba, Dragon Ball, YuYu Hakusho (localized as Ghost Fighter),
and Slam Dunk.

They were different from the Masked Rider Black, Power Rangers, Shaider, and Ultraman shows that were popular at the
time.

It was a great way of escapism.

The first manga I ever read was Naruto on OneManga, right after finishing the first season of Naruto Shippuden.

  <p class="pl-4 font-bold text-lg">I remember starting out in OneMange -> MangaFox -> MangaStream</p>
</details>

It was exciting to read ahead and see what would happen next.

From there, I moved on to other popular titles at the time—Bleach, One Piece, and Hunter x Hunter.

One of the best things about those early manga sites was the "Surprise Me" button.

It introduced me to different genres and all kinds of stories I wouldn’t have discovered otherwise.

## Looking Back: How It Started

As I read more and more, I started getting that déjà vu feeling—like I had seen certain pages before.

Then I’d realize… I already read this years ago and just forgot.

That’s when I decided to start listing the manga I was currently reading while also tracking completed titles.

Now, I have a backlog that I’m finally working through.

> To add checks and links to completed titles  
> Some items got removed, or I might have missed when exporting from Trello

The list keeps growing, though I did manage to write two posts recently.

There’s no particular order when adding to it—I just throw in new items as I read them.

I usually read by genre or author. These days, I’m more into Seinen (18+) manga.

I also need to learn how to upload videos properly next time.

I used OBS for this one, but there’s definitely room for improvement.

## What to Expect Moving Forward

I’ll be working on my latest reads first while they’re still fresh in my memory.

After that, I’ll revisit some of the classics—some I remember well even after a long time, while others will need a
re-read.

## Forgotten Manga: Lost Stories Rediscovered

Some forgotten titles I recently rediscovered include GE (which I noticed in my list) and Mx0, which I’m currently
re-reading.

There are plenty more waiting to be revisited.

## Closing Thoughts

So, let’s get started. This has been on the back burner for a long time, and it’s finally time to start chipping away at
it.

Will I ever finish this list? Who knows. My gaming backlog is the same—it just keeps growing without me realizing it.

That’s it for now. The list is in the video above.

Let me know your favorite manga and any recommendations in the comments below!
