## Introduction

I read a lot of manga, manhwa and watch a lot of anime since I was on my teens.

A few of the early anime I watched were Voltes V, Daimos, Yaiba, Dragon Ball, YuYu Hakusho or localized as Ghost Fighter and Slam Dunk.

Something different from the Masked Rider Black, Power Rangers, Shaider and Ultraman from that time.  

It was a great way of escapism.

First time I read manga was Naruto at OneMange after finishing Naruto Shippuden first season.

It was exciting to get to read what's going to happen next.

Then moved on to the popular titles at that time, Bleach then One Piece, Hunter X Hunter.

The "Surprise Me" button in that site exposed me to different genres and all kinds of stories.

## Looking Back: How It Started

As you read and read more sometimes you get the feeling that "Hey this page seems familiar like deja vu".

Then you notice you know what's going to happen next.

Turns out I've already read this way back and just forgot.

I started listing the current reading while also adding completed titles.

This is the current list that I am now working on.

## My Current Backlog

> "Sucking at something is the first step to becoming sorta good at something"  
> This is on the cover of one of my old posts [On writing blog posts](/posts/writing-blog-posts/)

The list keeps growing though I managed to write 2 posts recently.

There are no particular order when adding, just adding new items when I read them.

I usually read by genre or author. I am more into Seinen(18+) nowadays. 

I need to study next time how to upload videos better, used OBS.

## What to Expect Moving Forward

Working on the latest reads first so I have fresh memory then moving onto the classics.

Some manga that I like I remember even after a long time the moving onto some titles that might need a re read.

## Forgotten Manga: Lost Stories Rediscovered

A few at the top of my head are GE as I saw it in the list, Mx0 which I am currently re reading and more.

## Closing Thoughts

So let's get started, this has been at the back burner for a long time and I guess it's time to chip at it.

Will I ever finish this list? Let's see. This is the same with my games backlog.

They both are growing unnoticed.

That's it, the list is on the video above.

Let me know your favorites and recommendations in the comments below.
