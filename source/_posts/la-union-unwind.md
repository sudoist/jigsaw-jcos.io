### Good time to go to beach

Was getting burnt out after a really hard project.

I didn’t like beaches because it’s hot and I don’t know how to swim.

Somehow when trying out surfing it was really fun.

It’s like skating but on waves!

Plus it doesn’t hurt as much when falling into water.

Now on to catching bigger waves…

Oh. Need to learn how to swim first.
